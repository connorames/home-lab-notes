# Home Lab Notes

Welcome! This repo documents my self-hosting and homelab journey — both **retroactively** and **as it evolves**.

I've been self-hosting since **March 2025**, working hands-on with tools like **Linux**, **Docker**, **Plex**, **Tailscale**, and **Portainer** across a variety of devices (Optiplex, Raspberry Pi, Beelink mini PC, and Synology NAS).

This project serves a few goals:
- 📓 Archive lessons learned, fixes, configs, and experiments
- 🧠 Reinforce learning through documentation
- 💼 Share real-world experience for future employers and collaborators

---

## Topics Covered (and Growing)

- 🐧 Linux: CLI workflows, backups, automounting, Timeshift, udisks2 issues
- 🐳 Docker: Container setup, `docker-compose`, volume management
- 📦 Self-Hosted Services: Plex, Uptime Kuma, FileBrowser, Tautulli
- 🌐 Networking: Tailscale VPN, remote access, MagicDNS
- 🧰 Homelab Management: Portainer, monitoring, storage structure
- 🧪 Experiments & Failures: What didn’t work (and why)
